# Reddit Post Classification.
In this repo, I will scrape reddit to get approx. 1000 posts each related to popular front end frameworks like React, Angular and Vue. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis will also be done to get more insights about the data.   The following ML/DL models were used for text classification.
* TFIDF and Logistic Regression
* TFIDF and Random Forest.
